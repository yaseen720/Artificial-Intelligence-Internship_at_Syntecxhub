Maze Solver using A* Search Algorithm
This project implements a **Maze Solver** using the A* (A-Star) Search Algorithm to find the shortest path from a start point to a goal point in a grid-based maze.

 Project Overview
•	The maze is represented as a **2D grid**
•	`0` represents free cells and `1` represents walls
•	Each cell is treated as a node
•	The algorithm uses Manhattan Distance as the heuristic

Algorithm Used
•	A* Search Algorithm
•	Heuristic: Manhattan Distance
•	Ensures optimal and shortest path

Features
•	Finds the shortest path from start to goal
•	Handles unreachable cases gracefully
•	Visualizes the maze and final path
•	Saves output figure in 300 DPI for high-quality results

Visualization
The final path is visualized using `matplotlib` and saved in the same project folder.

Technologies Used
•	Python
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	Jupyter Notebook

 
 
Output
•	Red line: Shortest path
•	Green dot: Start point
•	Blue dot: Goal point
